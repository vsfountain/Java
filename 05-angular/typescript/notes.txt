Angular=2.0+      now we're in angular 7

Angular is a front end framework, written in typescript.

Who developed ReactJS? Facebook
who developed Angular? Google

Component based. In short, a component is a segment of front end

We use this framework because programming an application with js alone
    becomes difficult when web apps become more massive (scalability).
