/*
 * This is a Person class to show the serialization example
 * 
 * You have to 'white list' the objects that you want to be serializable
 * 		If not, NotSerializableException will be thrown during serialization
 * 
 * NOTE: Any class that inherits a Serializable class is also serializable.
 * NOTE: Make sure all instance variables are also serializable.
 * NOTE: Transient instance variables do not have to be Serializable.
 * 
 * 
 * private static final long serialVersionUID
 * 
 * serialVerionUID is important during deserialization
 * 		During deserialization, the JVM will check to make sure the
 * 		serialVersionUID of the serialized object matches that of the class.
 * 		If they don't match, an InvalidClassException is thrown.
 * 
 * 		However, the serialVersionUID is NOT required.  If it's not defined,
 * 		then the JVM will generate one based on things defined in the class.
 * 		It is strongly recommended to define the serialVersionUID because 
 * 		different JVMs (or even the same JVM) may generate different numbers.
